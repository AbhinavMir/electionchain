## ElectionChain ðŸ”—

This project is based on the blog available at [Cosmos SDK Tutorials/Polling app](https://tutorials.cosmos.network/voter/). 

### How to run

**Install Starport**
I personally prefer to build from Source.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/tendermint/starport && cd starport && make
```

Then, clone and serve.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/abhinavmir/electionchain
starport serve
```

### What is Cosmos Network and Starport

> Starport is the easiest way to build a blockchain. It is a developer-friendly interface to the [Cosmos SDK](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk), the world's most widely-used blockchain application framework. Starport generates boilerplate code for you, so you can focus on writing business logic.

And 

> Cosmos is a decentralized network of independent parallel blockchains, each powered by BFT consensus algorithms like [Tendermint](https://cosmos.network/intro#what-is-tendermint-core-and-the-abci) consensus.
